# Katalyst Digital Brand Guidelines

## Logo
- Primary logo should be used on light backgrounds with clear space equal to the height of the "K" around the mark.
- Use the monochrome logo variant on dark or highly textured backgrounds.

## Colors
- Primary: #0D1B2A (Navy), #1B263B (Deep Blue), #E0E1DD (Fog)
- Accent: #4ECDC4 (Teal), #F9A826 (Gold)
- Keep accessibility in mind with contrast ratios when pairing foreground and background colors.

## Typography
- Headings: "Poppins", semibold for H1/H2 and medium for H3+.
- Body: "Inter" or "Open Sans" for long-form content and UI labels.
- Maintain generous line-height (1.5+) for readability.

## Voice & Tone
- Confident, clear, and pragmatic; focus on outcomes for clients.
- Avoid jargon; communicate benefits and measurable impact.
- Use active verbs and client-centric statements.

## Asset Usage
- Store logo exports in `brand/logo/` by format (SVG, PNG, PDF).
- Maintain color palette references in `brand/colors/` with hex and RGB values.
- Keep font files and licensing references in `brand/typography/`.

## File Naming
- Use kebab-case (e.g., `katalyst-logo-primary.svg`).
- Append version or date for iterations (e.g., `proposal-template-v2-2024-08.pdf`).
